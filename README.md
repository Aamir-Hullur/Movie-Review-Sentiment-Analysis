# MovieReviewSentimentAnalysis

## Introduction
This repository contains a Streamlit app designed for sentiment analysis of movie reviews. It was created as part of my learning journey in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Streamlit. The project demonstrates the use of basic NLP techniques and the Streamlit framework to analyze and visualize the sentiment of movie reviews in real-time.

## Project Description
The `MovieReviewSentimentAnalysis` app utilizes two machine learning models, MultinomialNB and LinearSVC, to predict the sentiment of a given movie review as either positive or negative. It's an excellent example of how machine learning can be applied to text data, providing insights into the underlying emotions or opinions expressed in the reviews.

## Installation

To run this app locally, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage

After installation, you can run the app using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the Streamlit app in your default web browser, where you can input movie reviews and see the sentiment analysis results.

## Streamlit App

You can access the deployed Streamlit app here: [Movie Review Sentiment Analysis App](https://movie-review-sentiment-analysis.streamlit.app/)

## Acknowledgments

This project was created during my initial explorations into NLP and Streamlit. It's a beginner-friendly implementation, ideal for anyone starting their journey in these fields. Special thanks to the online communities and resources that helped me learn and understand the basics of NLP and Streamlit.
